## AI Projects (Deep Learning & Machine Learning)

  

This repository is created for my **AI projects**.

In this repository you can find and learn about:

> Implement Neural Network
> Implement Machine learning algorithms
> Use best optimizers for you algorithms
> Pre processing of your data
> Using ***Scikit-Learn***, ***Tensorflow*** and ***Keras***
> Implement and solve real and amazing problems using *AI algorithms**

### Install neccessary packages:
Before run these python codes you should install these neccessary softwares and packages to use:<br>
1- Install Python</br>
> **Note**: If you didn't install Python, Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install

2- Install Numpy and Pandas libraries
> **Numpy**: *pip install numpy*
> **Pandas**: *pip install pandas*

3- Install Scikit-Learn
> **Scikit-Learn**: *pip install -U scikit-learn*

4- Install Tensorflow
> **Tensorflow**: install *Tensorflow* according to your needs via this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)

 ### List of projects:
  [**Handwriting Recognizer**](https://github.com/pak-app/ai-projects/tree/main/01-mnist_dataset_hand_writing): In this project we are going to implement deep neural network to recognize digits from 0 to 9.
 <br>In this project you will learn how to prepare photos to analyze and train your neural network using **photos** !!!</br>
>**Note**: Because of github upload limitation you have to download dataset via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLeYjmjh7JfKPAqNg8lkQ5XVU7MxKTDf?usp=sharing)

[**Predict goal possibility**](https://github.com/pak-app/ai-projects/tree/main/02-goal_prediction): Are you fan of football ??
<br>If your answer is **Yes**, you will get all of fun out of this project !!!</br>
If your answer is **No** , don't worry you will get fun out of this project as much as football fans too and you may like this sport :)
<br>So in this project you have some features about players and theirs abilitie. In addition of that you have some information about player position to caculate propability of goal.</br>
In this project we use two diffrent models, **Deep Neural Network** and **SVM**.
> **Note**: This project was one of questions of quera's challange and its file is available in related link.


If these projects was helful and you enjoyed like me :heart:
Thank You :smile:
